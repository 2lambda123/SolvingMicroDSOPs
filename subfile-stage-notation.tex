  We need to define notation for these three steps within a {\interval}. We will use $\BegStget$ as a marker for the step before shocks have been realized, and $\EndStget$ as the indicator for the situation once the choice has been made, implicitly leaving the unmarked $\stge$ to indicate the step in which the decision is made.
