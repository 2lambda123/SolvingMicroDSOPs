  Although our focus so far has been on the consumer's consumption problem once $\mNrm$ is known, for articulating the steps of the computational solution it will be useful to distinguish a sequence of three steps (we use the word `steps' to capture the proposition that we are not really thinking of these as occurring at different moments in time -- only that we are putting the things that happen within a given moment into an ordered sequence).  The first step captures calculations that need to be performed before the shocks are realized, the middle step is after shocks have been realized but before the consumption decision has been made (this corresponds to the timing of $\vFunc$ in the treatment above), and the final step captures the situation \textit{after} the consumption decision has been made.
